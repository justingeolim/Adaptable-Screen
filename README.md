# Q4 – Responsive Layout Challenge: Phone vs Tablet

## Overview
Implementation of a single screen that adapts its layout based on screen width. It uses LocalConfiguration. On narrow screens (vertical phone view), it displays a single Column list. On wide screens (horizontal tablet view), it switches to a two-pane Row with a navigation list on the left and content on the right. Included CS courses as its content.
